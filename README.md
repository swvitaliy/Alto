# Alto-lite

Fork of [Alto](https://github.com/TryGhost/Alto) theme. Key differences and features:

    - removed featured post, pictures in the post feed, etc
    - removed author of a post (for personal blog it is useless)
    - dark reader support
    - fix github actions deploy script (added "yarn build" step)
    - decrease distanse between header and excerpt in the posts feed (margin-bottom reduced to 10px)
    - Except posts with "translation" tag from main page feed (it shown on other page)
